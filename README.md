# MERN Boot Camp Final Project

This full-stack web application is meant to simulate a banking app whereby a user can create a new account, log in to an existing account, and make deposits & withdraws. The app's theme is the Dark Web, but rest assured that this is just for fun. No actual access to the dark web provided from the app. You can access the deployed (parody) app [here](https://mern-banking-app-c47015ff9ef1.herokuapp.com/#/).

            Wow, thanks BotDW! After my successful Ponzi scheme, I had loads of
            cash and no way to hide it all. Dave Ramsey's call-in show was no
            help. So I created a new account in seconds and now I can finally
            buy that LÃ¼rssen Al Lusail I've been dreaming of! <br />- "Timmy" in

            You're a life saver, Bank of the Dark Web. I had the Feds breathing
            down my neck after a successful embezzling campaign, but now I can
            sleep in peace knowing that all my laundered money is safe within
            your hallowed vaults. You saved my finances, my career, and my
            marriage. Five stars and a triumph of the human spirit! <br />-
